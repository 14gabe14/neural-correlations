# Neural Correlations: Exploring Neuron Populations and Behavior Relationships

Welcome to the **Neural Correlations** project! This repository contains a comprehensive exploration and analysis of neuron populations linked to behavior through cross-correlation and statistical measures. This project was developed as part of the Computational Neuroscience course offered by the NeuroMatch Academy.

## About the Dataset

We have utilized the Stringer dataset of 10,000 neuron recordings, generously provided by Marius Pachitariu. This dataset is an exemplar of the trend in modern neuroscience, where the capacity to simultaneously record neural activity has been dramatically expanded. This dataset showcases the remarkable capability of technologies like calcium imaging and neuropixel probes, allowing researchers to capture neural dynamics with unprecedented detail.

## Understanding the Data

In this dataset, a mouse's neural activity from the visual cortex was recorded while it engaged in spontaneous behaviors such as locomotion, whisking, sniffing, and grooming behaviors. Notably, the recordings were conducted in complete darkness, rendering the absence of sensory input a unique feature of this study. The dataset includes several quantifications of these behaviors, enabling us to investigate their relationship with neural activity.
